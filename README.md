# Angular Custom Bootstrap Daterangepicker
A custom date range picker component used to create a drop-down menu from which a user can select a range of dates.

This version is customised for my projects. Feel free to use it as it is or customise it as you want. Please note that all credits goes to the original developers [Dan Grossman](https://github.com/rstudio/bootstrap-daterangepicker).

Features include limiting the selectable date range, localizable strings and date formats, a single date picker mode, a time picker, and predefined date ranges.
